Yumcha serves up 1-1 pegged tokens that backed by the underlying asset held in reserves.

Yumcha VT (ycVT) is a 1-1 peg to the Vanguard Total World Stock with the underlying stock held in reserve. 
There are currently 3000 VT held in reserve waiting to be minted.

You can buy and sell ycVT from pancakeswap.

Alternatively, you can mint ycVT directly by sending BUSD to the Dev Address 0xABE4A3Ecc5C65E6BC71CfA036d1feC134d92ed75. 
The Dev address will then airdrop you ycVT at the Yahoo price (less a 1% handling fee). Minimum 1000 BUSD.

The ycVT may be then added to the liquidity pool ycVT-BUSD and staked below to earn yumcha governance tokens. 
Note there is a 1% deposit fee for the ycVT-BUSD pool. There are no fees for the yumcha-BUSD pool.
